# My-Computer-Vision-Experiments

This repository is a sandbox for me to learn more about machine learning/deep learning/image processing techniques.

## Datasets Used

- [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist)
- [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

## Experiments Run
- `pretrained_models.py` - to play around with transfer learning using pre-trained models from PyTorch.
